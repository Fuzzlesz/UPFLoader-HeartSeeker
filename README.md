# HeartSeekerUPFLoader



Loader for HeartSeeker Skyrim UPF Patch:<br>
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37741

This loader gathers the mods from your load order that contain the records HeartSeeker wants to edit.

This outputs "HeartSeekerLoader.esp", which you then load in with zEdit to workaround zEdit's 255 plugin limit.

Once you've created your zEdit patch, please delete the loader esp.

This also outputs a dummy Synthesis.esp. Please only run this patch alone, and make a backup or rename any other "Synthesis.esp".

Be sure to check for conflicts in your created zEdit patch afterwards in xEdit.



Inspired by: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35012 <br>
This loader was made due to the xEdit script missing some mods that need to be included.
