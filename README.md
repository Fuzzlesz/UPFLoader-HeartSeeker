# HeartSeekerUPFLoader



Incomplete loader for HeartSeeker Skyrim UPF Patch:<br>
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37741

This loader gathers the mods from your load order that contain the records HeartSeeker wants to edit.

This outputs "HeartSeekerLoader.esp", which you then load in with zEdit to workaround zEdit's 255 plugin limit.

***THIS IS INCOMPLETE AND DOES NOT WORK IN CURRENT STATE, DO NOT USE***
